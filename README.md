# 2023-SP-6604-HW2

Implement a Replication scheme for the Token-ring mutual exclusion algorithm.

1. Show a logical ring of MSSs where MHs will be making the requests for tokens.

2. Show how the requests are sent to all other MSSs and how the requests are granted to an MH with the highest priority request in a cell. 

3. Show the logs of the requests at each MSS and the priorities assigned.

4. Show the queue after the requests have been served at any given MSS.
